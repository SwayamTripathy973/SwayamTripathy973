        <h2>Contract</h2>

        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Swayam Tripathy</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2024 ITIS3135 Web Application Design and Development with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world, and I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

        <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class, it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e., external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>

        <p>Signed: <em>Swayam Tripathy</em>, 08/03/2025</p>
